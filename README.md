Gorilla Starter Theme


This blueprint theme is meant for hacking so don't use it as just as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning this into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. 

* Full Bootstrap Power, seamlessly integrated in Automattic's starter theme _s to bring these two together the cleanest way.
* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A sample custom header implementation in `includes/custom-header.php` that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `includes/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `includes/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* Keyboard navigation for image attachment templates. The script can be found in `js/keyboard-navigation.js`. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* Licensed under GPLv3 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.

Getting Started
---------------
TODO


Then, update the stylesheet header in style.css and the links in footer.php with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
